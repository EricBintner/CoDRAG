# Opportunities — Phase 02 (Dashboard)

## Purpose
Capture UX and settings opportunities that increase trust and reduce operational friction.

## Opportunities
- **Freshness UX**: surface *why* a project is stale (changed paths count, last event time, last successful build), not just “stale”.
- **Settings presets**: “Laptop”, “Workstation”, “Monorepo” profiles controlling debounce, concurrency, polling fallback, and embedding batch sizing.
- **Failure playbooks**: show actionable remediation (exclude problematic file, reduce batch size, restart provider) instead of generic errors.
