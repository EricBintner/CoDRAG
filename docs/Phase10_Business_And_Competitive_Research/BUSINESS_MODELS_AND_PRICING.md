# Business Models and Pricing

## Purpose
This document summarizes business model patterns relevant to CoDRAG’s goals:
- Self-contained local-first companion app
- App-store + direct-download distribution (macOS/Windows)
- Enterprise tier roadmap with per-seat licensing

It is intentionally **decision-oriented** (what should CoDRAG do next), not a generic market report.

## Comparable business model patterns

### Pattern A: Free core app + paid optional services (local-first)
Example: Obsidian
- Core app is free.
- Monetization is via optional services like Sync.

### Pattern B: Free personal use + paid org use (trust + admin controls)
Example: Docker Desktop
- Personal tier is free.
- Paid tiers introduce org features (SSO/SCIM, admin controls, invoice purchasing).

### Pattern C: Per-seat assistant with clear “Business” and “Enterprise” differentiation
Examples:
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Windsurf

Signals:
- Individuals pay ~$10–$20/mo.
- Team tiers frequently move to $30–$40/user/mo.
- Enterprise pricing is higher ($39/user/mo and up) or custom.

### Pattern D: “Local-first memory” with a Pro tier
Example: Pieces for Developers
- Free tier exists.
- Pro tier monetizes access to premium capabilities.

### Pattern E: Enterprise deploy-anywhere posture (BYOK/on-prem) with per-seat enterprise pricing
Example: Tabnine
- Pro and Enterprise tiers are explicitly positioned around privacy and deployment flexibility.

### Pattern F: On-prem or “serverless” enterprise license management
Example: GitKraken on-prem pricing
- Options for self-hosted license server (LDAP) or serverless license management.

## Decision: The "License-First" Model

We have selected a **Perpetual License** model for individuals and a **Seat-Based Subscription** for teams.

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with "Local-First" ethos (ownership vs rent).
- Low COGS (BYOK) allows avoiding the "AI Subscription" trap.
- Creates trust with privacy-conscious developers.

**The Strategy (The "Context Drug" Ladder):**
- **Free:** 1 repo, manual refresh (The Hook).
- **Starter:** $29/4-mo pass, 3 repos, real-time watcher, Trace Index + Full MCP (The Bridge).
- **Pro:** $79 One-time, Unlimited repos, everything in Starter + multi-repo workflows (Ownership).
- **Team:** $15/mo/seat, Shared config/index (Standardization).
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for air-gapped/compliance needs.

See the detailed strategy in: [Pricing/PRICING_STRATEGY.md](Pricing/PRICING_STRATEGY.md)

## Decision outputs
- **Adoption funnel:** Free (1 repo) -> Starter ($29/4mo) -> Pro License ($79).
- **Packaging:**
    - **Free:** 1 active repo, manual indexing.
    - **Starter:** 3 active repos, real-time indexing, Trace Index (structural), Full MCP.
    - **Pro:** Unlimited repos, everything in Starter + multi-repo workflows.
    - **Team:** Shared configs, License management.
- **Cloud requirement:** None for Pro. Optional "Team Server" for shared configs/indexes in Phase 6.
