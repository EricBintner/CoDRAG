## Links
- Spec: `README.md`
- Opportunities: `opportunities.md`
- Master orchestrator: `../MASTER_TODO.md`
- Roadmap: `../ROADMAP.md`
- Decision log: `../DECISIONS.md`

## Research cadence (P10-C*)
- [ ] P10-C1 Establish monthly lightweight competitor scan process
- [ ] P10-C2 Establish quarterly deep update process
- [ ] P10-C3 Maintain “table stakes vs differentiators” matrix aligned to CoDRAG phases

## Decision outputs (P10-D*)
- [x] P10-D1 Confirm initial ICP for MVP (Solo Devs using Cursor/Windsurf)
- [x] P10-D2 Confirm deployment model assumptions (Local-only MVP; Team/Embedded post-MVP)
- [x] P10-D3 Confirm packaging tiers mapping to feature surfaces (Free/Starter/Pro/Team/Enterprise)
- [x] P10-D4 Confirm pricing model assumptions (Perpetual for Indie, Subscription for Team, Offline Licensing)

## Feedback loop into product (P10-F*)
- [ ] P10-F1 Define explicit rule: competitive insight must produce:
  - ADR change
  - ROADMAP change
  - or phase README update
- [ ] P10-F2 Track competitor “watch list” items that could invalidate roadmap bets

## Notes / blockers
- [ ] Implement "Founder’s Edition" licensing logic in Phase 11
