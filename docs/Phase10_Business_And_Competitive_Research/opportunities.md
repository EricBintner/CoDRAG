# Opportunities — Phase 10 (Business Plan & Competitive Research)

## Purpose
Track competitive opportunities that should influence roadmap bets.

## Opportunities
- **Treat “local-first + MCP” as table stakes**: ChunkHound exists and is OSS. CoDRAG must win on trust UX, freshness, and product polish.
- **Differentiation to emphasize**:
  - inspectable retrieval UI (status + citations + errors)
  - freshness-first trust loop (stale signals + recovery)
  - trace-assisted grounding for structural questions
- **Watch list**: if ChunkHound ships a polished desktop UI or multi-project registry, the competitive gap narrows.
