# Opportunities — Phase 09 (Post-MVP)

## Purpose
Track high-leverage expansion ideas inspired by competitor capabilities and real-world adoption needs.

## Opportunities
- **Multi-language indexing strategy**: evaluate Tree-sitter adoption (broad language coverage) vs a curated best-supported set.
- **Multi-hop retrieval**: use trace edges + search results as a principled alternative to “LLM-only research” pipelines.
- **Autonomous background tasks (opt-in)**:
  - periodic architecture summaries
  - “what changed?” reports after merges
  - curated traceability generation (plans/decisions/research ↔ code)
- **Plugin system**: allow external parsers/analyzers for niche languages or proprietary formats.
