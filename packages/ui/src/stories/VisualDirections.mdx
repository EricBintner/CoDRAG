# Visual Directions

CoDRAG supports multiple visual themes to accommodate different developer preferences and environments. These themes are implemented as CSS variable sets that override the semantic design tokens.

You can switch between these themes using the **Visual Style** toolbar item above (paintbrush icon).

## Theme Inventory

### Core Themes

| ID | Name | Description |

| **a** | **Slate Developer** | A clean, neutral theme inspired by modern developer tools (Vercel, Linear). Low saturation, high legibility. |
| **b** | **Deep Focus** | High contrast dark mode with deep blues/purples. Designed for long coding sessions. |
| **c** | **Signal Green** | Retro-terminal inspired with a modern twist. High contrast green accents. |

### Stylized Themes

| **f** | **Swiss Minimal** | Focus on typography and whitespace. Very sparse UI elements. |
| **g** | **Glass-Morphic** | Uses translucency and blur effects for depth (requires backdrop support). |

## How to Test

1.  Navigate to the **Pages / Dashboard** story.
2.  Use the **Visual Style** toolbar menu to select a theme.
3.  Toggle **Mode** (Sun/Moon icon) to see Light/Dark variants (note: some themes are Dark-only or have limited Light modes).

## Implementation

Themes are applied via `data-codrag-theme` attribute on the `<html>` or `<body>` element.

```css
/* Example: applying theme 'h' */
:root[data-codrag-theme='h'] {
  --background: 260 20% 10%;
  --primary: 320 100% 50%;
  /* ... overrides ... */
}
```

This allows us to ship a single CSS bundle and switch themes instantly at runtime without reloading.
