# Opportunities — Phase 13 (Storybook)

## Purpose
Capture design-system/UI opportunities that make advanced indexing controls approachable.

## Opportunities
- **Advanced settings UX**: group controls by intent (Freshness, Performance, Providers, Safety) with safe defaults + progressive disclosure.
- **Index status components**: reusable status badges (Fresh/Stale/Building/Pending/Throttled) + build progress timeline.
- **Troubleshooting components**: error code blocks, remediation panels, “Copy diagnostics” UI patterns.
- **Trace exploration UX**: node detail panel and neighbors view that stays bounded and understandable.
