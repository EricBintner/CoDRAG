# Phase 09 — Post-MVP TODO

## Links
- Spec: `README.md`
- Opportunities: `opportunities.md`
- Master orchestrator: `../MASTER_TODO.md`

## Backlog conversion (P09-B*)
- [ ] P09-B1 Create a prioritized candidate list (top 10) with explicit owners
- [ ] P09-B2 For each top item, write a mini-spec using the template in `README.md`
- [ ] P09-B3 For each mini-spec, include de-scope/rollback plan

## Prioritization rubric + process (P09-P*)
- [ ] P09-P1 Implement scoring rubric (impact/feasibility/risk/strategic alignment)
- [ ] P09-P2 Define intake sources and cadence (user feedback, friction logs, competitive)
- [ ] P09-P3 Define decision recording flow:
  - ADR update when architecture/contracts change
  - ROADMAP update when scope/timeline changes

## Cross-phase strategy watchlist (P09-S*)
- [ ] P09-S1 Multi-language strategy decision (Tree-sitter vs curated)
- [ ] P09-S2 Plugin system boundary (analyzers, curated traceability ingestion)
- [ ] P09-S3 Cross-project search guardrails (opt-in, project identity in citations)

## Notes / blockers
- [ ] Define what “post-MVP stable baseline” means before scheduling expansions
