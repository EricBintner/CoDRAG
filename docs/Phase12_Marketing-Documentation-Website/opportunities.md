# Opportunities — Phase 12 (Marketing Website + Public Documentation)

## Purpose
Capture messaging opportunities that are both differentiating and honest.

## Opportunities
- **Position against CLI-first indexers**: emphasize inspectability, freshness UX, and curated context controls.
- **Trust-first framing**: “right project, fresh index, verifiable sources” as the headline differentiation.
- **No config foot-guns**: highlight that shared configs are secret-free; provider keys stay local.
